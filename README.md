Repository for the analysis of YouTube comments. Extracts information on:

1. Donations on the video (converted to a target currency)
2. Translation of comments to English
3. Sentiment analysis on the comments
4. Extraction of relevant terms from extremely positive/negative comments
5. Estimation of the dislikes on a video based on likes and comment polarity

## Preparation
